# My Baby – a health tracker for babies.
### Project Description
My Baby is a health tracker for babies. New parents need a way to keep track and remember their babies sleep and diaper changes when their mind turns to mush from lack of sleep. 
### Problem statement
As most new parents soon find out, birth was just the start of the fun. The first few weeks after birth are tough for both parents. Your baby is sleeping every few hours, waking up, feeding, changing diapers and clothes, and repeat. It is important to keep track of these things in case your baby gets sick and just to make sure your new born is developing correctly. The problem is that you are sleep deprived, Not sleeping more than a few hours every night, and your mind is turning to mush.  
### How will your project solve this problem?
This is where My Baby can help, with a simple but intuitive mobile interface, parents can keep track of their baby’s sleep and awake cycles, and how often they are changing their diapers and what kind of dirty diapers they are having.  Parents will be able to see these data markers visualized in varies charts and graphs to allow them to see the patterns and changes that their little one is going through.    
### Map the user experience
Parents and users will be prompted to ether sign in or create an account using Oauth with google authentication, once signed in users will be directed to their profile page showing their babies stats. From here they can create new entries of for baby via the sleep or diaper tracker page. The sleep tracker is simply drop menu with increments of time to show how long they slept and at what time. There is also a start and stop timer to do this all for you. In the diaper tracker there is a simple input form to select to create a diaper change timestamp and what kind of dirty diaper.
